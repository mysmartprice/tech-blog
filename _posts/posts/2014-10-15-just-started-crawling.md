At MySmartPrice, we completed 4 years last week and our first employee is completing his 3 year of employment with us today. I joined MySmartPrice as first engineer in February 2012 and in less than 3 years, we have grown to a team of almost 20 engineer with average age of 23. It will be an injustice to say the journey was exciting. It was nothing less than a roller-coaster ride.

- We have scaled from almost 2 million to 15 million visits a month in last 2 years. (Thanks to our caching layer)
- Our crawler fetches products and their data points like price, delivery, cod and others for almost 3 million products aggregated from more than 30 e-commerce stores.
- Designed and implemented our own analytics to gather information about our website usage and sales conversion.

We are in a mission to make online shopping transparent and help the end user make their shopping decisions easily. Now we strongly feel that it is time to share our learning and knowledge with the community. We are completly built upon open-source softwares like Redis, SOLR, NGINX and others.

Today, we are launching this blog to talk about engineering @ MySmartPrice. I know it is kind of late but it's better late than never. As an engineering initiative, we are taking some effort to share some of our learning while trying to build the best shopping platform for India. In future posts, we shall write about our technology stack, crawler optimization techniques, How we integated MySmartPrice with WhatsApp and other interesting (secret) stuff which we are currently working on.

Live Long and Prosper!!
